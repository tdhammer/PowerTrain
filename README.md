# PowerTrain App

Android app project to generate/record power (watts) information while training on a bicycle trainer
with multiple levels but no digital power output to capture (*non-smart trainer*).

Based on the concepts of [TrainerRoad's VirtualPower](https://www.trainerroad.com/virtual-power) and [working with non-smart trainers](https://support.trainerroad.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002491883-VirtualPower-What-if-my-trainer-isn-t-supported-) I wanted a tool to capture the data for use in personal analysis.
